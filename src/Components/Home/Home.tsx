                        Graduated with a bachelor's in Computer Science. I'm a lifelong
                        student with a deep passion for all things computer science. My
                        personal goal is to become a full-stack developer with some strong
                        cloud expertise. Right now, I'm focused on advancing my front-end
                        skills by building websites and incorporating new technologies
                        into each projectâ€”like using React Router to enhance this very
                        site! I'm also currently preparing for the AWS Solutions Architect
                        exam to strengthen my cloud knowledge.
